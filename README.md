Python

**TikTok** is a social media platform for creating, sharing, and discovering short-form videos. TikTok allows users to create short videos that can be up to 60 seconds and more, featuring music, sound effects, filters, and other creative tools. 

Users can also interact with other users' videos by commenting, liking, and sharing them. Despite its entertaining content, this application is not liked by everyone. If you skim through its reviews, you’ll find a mixture of hate and support for TikTok all over the world.

**Sentiment analysis of reviews** is a type of natural language processing (NLP) that involves analyzing the opinions, emotions, and attitudes expressed in a piece of text, typically a review or a feedback. 

The **goal of sentiment analysis** is to identify and extract subjective information from the text, such as whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment or opinion.
Let's analyze TikTok Reviews to find out what people feel about the content of this app.

This project will go through the task of **TikTok reviews sentiment analysis.**
The dataset I am gonna use for sentiment analysis was downloaded from kaggle. It was scrapped from TikTok reviews on Google play store and it has been processed to a format that fit for sentiment analysis, though more data manipulations would be done.
